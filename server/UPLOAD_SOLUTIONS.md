# File Upload Solutions for Production

## 🔴 Problem
Local disk storage (`multer.diskStorage`) doesn't work on hosting platforms like Render, Heroku, Railway, or Vercel because:
- Files are stored in ephemeral file systems (deleted on restart)
- No persistent storage between deployments
- Multiple server instances can't share local files

## ✅ Solution 1: Cloudinary (RECOMMENDED - Already Configured!)

Your app already has Cloudinary configured. Just enable it:

### Steps:
1. **Sign up for Cloudinary** (Free tier: 25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month)
   - Visit: https://cloudinary.com/users/register_free

2. **Get your credentials** from Cloudinary Dashboard

3. **Add environment variables** to your hosting platform:
   ```env
   USE_CLOUDINARY=true
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
   ```

4. **Deploy** - Uploads will now work automatically!

### Pros:
- ✅ Already integrated in your code
- ✅ Free tier is generous
- ✅ CDN delivery (fast worldwide)
- ✅ Image transformations included
- ✅ No code changes needed

### Cons:
- ❌ Free tier limits (25GB/month bandwidth)

### Solution 2: AWS S3 + Multer-S3

**Best for:** Large-scale applications, more control

```bash
npm install multer-s3 @aws-sdk/client-s3
```

**Configuration:**
```javascript
import { S3Client } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import multerS3 from 'multer-s3';

const s3 = new S3Client({
  region: process.env.AWS_REGION,
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
    secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  }
});

const s3Storage = multerS3({
  s3: s3,
  bucket: process.env.AWS_BUCKET_NAME,
  metadata: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, { fieldName: file.fieldname });
  },
  key: (req, file, cb) => {
    const uniqueSuffix = Date.now() + '-' + Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9);
    cb(null, `avatars/avatar-${uniqueSuffix}${path.extname(file.originalname)}`);
  }
});

export const uploadAvatar = multer({ storage: s3Storage });
```

**Environment Variables:**
```env
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Very cheap (first 5GB free, then ~$0.023/GB)
- ✅ Unlimited scalability
- ✅ Full control

**Cons:**
- ❌ More complex setup
- ❌ Requires AWS account
- ❌ Need to configure bucket policies

### Solution 3: Supabase Storage

**Best for:** Modern stack, PostgreSQL users

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

**Configuration:**
```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_KEY
);

// Custom upload handler
export const uploadToSupabase = async (file, bucket, path) => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
    .from(bucket)
    .upload(path, file.buffer, {
      contentType: file.mimetype,
      upsert: false
    });
  
  if (error) throw error;
  
  const { data: { publicUrl } } = supabase.storage
    .from(bucket)
    .getPublicUrl(data.path);
  
  return publicUrl;
};

## 🚀 Quick Start (Cloudinary)

1. **Create account:** https://cloudinary.com/users/register_free

2. **Copy credentials** from dashboard

3. **Update your `.env` file:**
   ```env
   USE_CLOUDINARY=true
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
   ```

4. **Add to hosting platform** (Render/Heroku):
   - Go to Environment Variables section
   - Add the same variables

5. **Redeploy** - Done! ✅

---

## 🧪 Testing

Test locally with Cloudinary:
```bash
# In server directory
npm run dev
```

Test upload endpoints:
- Avatar: `POST /api/users/upload-avatar-public`
- Event Image: `POST /api/events/upload-image`
- Payment: `POST /api/payments/offline`

---

## 📝 Notes

- Your code already supports both local and Cloudinary storage
- Switch is automatic based on `USE_CLOUDINARY` env variable
- No code changes needed - just set environment variables
- Cloudinary URLs are returned directly from `req.file.path`
- Local storage URLs are constructed from `req.file.filename`

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Uploads still not working?**
1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify Cloudinary credentials are valid
3. Check server logs for errors
4. Ensure `USE_CLOUDINARY=true` (not 'True' or '1')
5. Restart your server after adding env variables

**Images not displaying?**
1. Check the returned URL in API response
2. Verify CORS settings if accessing from different domain
3. Check Cloudinary dashboard to see if files were uploaded

---

## 💡 Recommendation

**Use Cloudinary** - It's already configured in your code and offers the best free tier for your use case. Just add the environment variables and you're done!
