## üîê Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:

- Regularly rotate API secrets

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Hardcode credentials in source code
- Share credentials publicly
- Commit `.env` to version control
- Use same credentials across multiple projects

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

After setup is complete:

1. ‚úÖ Test all upload endpoints
2. ‚úÖ Verify images appear in Cloudinary dashboard
3. ‚úÖ Check database contains Cloudinary URLs
4. ‚úÖ Test image loading on frontend
5. ‚úÖ Monitor usage in Cloudinary console

---

## üí° Pro Tips

### Optimize Images:
Cloudinary automatically optimizes images. Your current config includes:
- Avatars: 500x500px, face-focused cropping
- Events: 1200x800px, limited size
- Payments: 1000x1000px, limited size

### Backup Strategy:
- Cloudinary stores your images reliably
- Consider periodic exports for critical data
- Database contains URLs, so you can always access images

### Cost Management:
- Free tier is usually sufficient for small-medium apps
- Monitor usage monthly
- Upgrade only when needed (starts at $89/month for Pro)
