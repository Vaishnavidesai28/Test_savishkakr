# ðŸš€ Fix Email on Render - Switch to SendGrid

## Problem: Gmail Doesn't Work on Render

Gmail SMTP is often blocked on Render's infrastructure. This is why email works on localhost but fails on Render.

## âœ… Solution: Use SendGrid (10 minutes setup)

SendGrid is free, reliable, and designed for production email sending.
