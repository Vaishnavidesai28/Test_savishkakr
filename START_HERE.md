# 🚀 START HERE - Fix Email on Render

## Your Situation

✅ Project deployed on Render  
✅ Environment variables added  
❌ Emails not sending (not even in spam)

---

## ⚡ Quick Fix (5 Minutes)

### 1. Get Gmail App Password (2 min)

🔗 https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

- Enable 2FA first if not enabled
- Generate App Password for "Mail"
- Copy the 16-character password
- **REMOVE ALL SPACES!**

### 2. Update Render Variables (1 min)

Go to: Render Dashboard → Your Service → **Environment**

Add/Update these 4 variables:
```
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=abcdefghijklmnop
```
*(Use your actual email and app password with NO spaces)*

Click **"Save Changes"**

### 3. Deploy Code Changes (2 min)

**In your terminal:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Increase email timeouts for Render"
git push
```

**On Render:**
- Click **"Manual Deploy"** → **"Deploy latest commit"**
- Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment

### 4. Check Logs (30 sec)

Click **"Logs"** tab, look for:

✅ **Success:**
```
✅ Email: CONFIGURED
   Host: smtp.gmail.com
```

❌ **Problem:**
```
⚠️ Email: NOT CONFIGURED
```

If you see problem, go back to step 2.

### 5. Test (30 sec)

- Go to your live Render URL
- Register a new user
- Check email inbox (and spam)

## 🔧 What I Fixed

I've made these code changes for you:

1. ✅ **Increased email timeouts** (10s → 30s)
   - Handles Render cold starts better
   - File: `server/utils/sendEmail.js`

2. ✅ **Added diagnostic tool**
   - Test email locally: `npm run diagnose-email`
   - File: `server/scripts/diagnoseEmail.js`

**You need to deploy these changes!** (See step 3 above)

## 🧪 Test Locally First (Optional)

This will:
- Check all variables are set
- Test Gmail connection
- Send test email
- Show specific errors if any

## 🚨 Most Common Mistakes

1. ❌ **Spaces in App Password**
   - Wrong: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`
   - Right: `abcdefghijklmnop`

2. ❌ **Not redeploying after changes**
   - Must click "Manual Deploy" on Render
   - Must push code to GitHub first

3. ❌ **Wrong variable names**
   - Must be EXACT: `EMAIL_HOST` not `email_host`

4. ❌ **Using regular Gmail password**
   - Must use App Password, not your login password

5. ❌ **2FA not enabled**
   - Can't generate App Password without 2FA

---

## ✅ Checklist

Before asking for help, verify:

- [ ] 2FA enabled on Gmail
- [ ] App Password generated (16 chars, no spaces)
- [ ] All 4 variables set on Render (exact names)
- [ ] Code changes pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Manually deployed on Render
- [ ] Checked logs after deployment
- [ ] Logs show "Email: CONFIGURED"

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

Run diagnostic locally:
```bash
cd server
npm run diagnose-email
```

Then share with me:
1. What does the diagnostic show?
2. What do Render logs show?
3. What error message do you see?

## 🌐 About Render Testing vs Production

**Current (Testing):**
- Free Render tier
- `.onrender.com` URLs
- Service sleeps after 15 min
- Good for testing

**Future (Production):**
- Custom domain (e.g., `savishkar.tech`)
- Frontend on Vercel (free)
- Backend on Render paid ($7/mo)
- Always available, faster

Read `RENDER_VS_DOMAIN.md` for migration guide when ready.
